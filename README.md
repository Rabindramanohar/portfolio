All about my life

#My Details: 

My journey started from Dhanbad which is also known as coal capital of India. After finishing my
12th from Guru Gobind Singh Public School, Dhanbad. I choose my career as Engineering so I
took admission in JIS College of Engineering, West Bengal. At that time I was very much
interested in video games so decided to choose Computer Science and Engineering as a
stream. I don't know what I learned in my past four years of engineering but one thing is clear I
make friends for my lifetime.
After completed my B.tech, went to Bangalore which is also known as silicon valley of India.
There I joined an institute called Jspiders' to improve my skills because I wanted to become a
software developer. Six months of struggle and hard work showed result and got an offer from
Zensar Technologies. I was happy because they want only Java certified candidates and I got
trained in JAVA, J2EE and Web Technology from last six months. I always wanted to become a
Data Science and working in backend technologies will help me to achieve my goal. Because
working in backend means most of the time I need to play with data and Data scientists means
the combination of analytic, machine learning, data mining and statistical skills, as well as
experience with algorithms and coding.
So I joined Zensar Technologies by May 2018. A company is a service based company with
offices in over eighteen countries. Zensar working on many sections, Retail consumer
services(RCS) is one of them. Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to
customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit. Zensar has many retail
clients some of them are Liverpool, Michael Kors, AEO, DDF, etc. I came under RCS section, so
I got training on JAVA, J2EE and ATG 11.2 for 3 months.
After that, they deployed me in a project called Liverpool Mirakl Implementation in Hyderabad.
Here I worked for four months and did mainly bug fixing. After that, I am in the pool so in my
bench periods I learned technologies like Angularjs, Node js, and spring core because these
technologies help me to achieve my goals. And now I am desperately looking for a project so I
can work as a team, apply my skills and challenge myself to achieve the commitment.
